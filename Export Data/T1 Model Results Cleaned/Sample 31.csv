0,0,3. Background
1,1,"The beginning of work on cross-culture aspects of design was seen in 1970. Publications on culture and product design reached at peak in 1975 (Honold, 2000). After 1990, another aspect of cultural usability was in the headlines - designers started to emphasize on interface for global audience. They started to seek help from the domain experts and human interface professionals to make terminologies for universal audience SO that they could be universally used for global internet and application users. Russo and Boor suggested translation of text into local language as a first step in preparing a product for international users (Russo P and Boor S, 1993). So Experts started to work on translations of products to make it internationally recognizable. But there was a contradiction of image acceptability to different cultures because some images acceptable in one culture were non-comprehensible to another culture. As Russo and Boor described, the American ""OK"" hand gesture is considered vulgar in Brazil and Germany (Russo and Boor). There are many interpretations of symbols in different cultures when companies would make their products for international users."
14,2,"Computer is slowly but surely becoming ubiquitous (Fernades, 1995). Main human computer conferences started to talk about the study for international users and differences in users in the mid nineties. Initially, large companies took initiatives to make applications and translated in different languages as initial step towards globalization and internationalization of applications, but Fernades (1995) describes that for financial and strategic reasons, companies tried to make their product globally acceptable with minimum amount of modification (Fernades, 1995). Evers and Day (1997) discussed the research proposition of cultural differences and expressed that users' culturally specific design preference influence their perception about system ease of use and concluded the result that Chinese find usefulness a more discernible variable, while Indonesians find ease of use more importuned. They suggested that the Chinese try to work with a useful interface even when it is hard to use. Indonesians, however will tend to give up more easy when an interface is hard to understand (Evers and Day, 1997)."
27,3,"Asian and Western cultures organize and group objects with different approach. Western people tend to group objects by categories where as Asian people tend to group objects on the base of their relationship. Studies of Li-jun Ji, Zhiyong Zhanda and Nisbett RE (2002) showed same kind of result. Students were provided with different sets of words (e.g., panda, monkey and banana) and they were asked to indicate which two of the three words were most closely related. The American participants made groups on the base of common categories. They put panda and monkey into the animal category. The Chinese participants made grouping on the base of their thematic relationship and put monkey and banana in one category. They justified their answer by saying that monkeys eat bananas (Nisbett RE, 2003; p.141). The difference in grouping of objects in different cultures pores a lot of questions to answer."
38,4,The primary goal of information systems should be to provide uncomplicated information structure to the users keeping their cultural background in mind and localizing application in a way that not only includes language transformation but also keeps the cultural and intellectual level of the people for which it is going to be made.
