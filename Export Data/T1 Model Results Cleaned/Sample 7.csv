The comparative unity that it had in previous ages, in its aims, its problems and methods, has been lost. When, with the beginning of modern times, re- ligious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention, men of intellect were lifted by a new belief, their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science.
