0,0,What is FRBR?
1,1,items and navigation through the sometimes complex network of the bibliographic universe 3
3,2,"Content relationships can be viewed as a continuum from works/expressions/ manifestations/items. Moving left to right along this continuum we start with some original work and related works and expressions and manifestations that can be considered 'equivalent,' that is, they share the same intellectual or artistic content as realised through the same mode of expression. Next we come to works/expres- sions/manifestations that are related through a 'derivative' relationship. These com- prise a range of new expressions, such as translations, different performances, slight modifications and editions that move along the continuum across a magic line where they become a new work yet still related to some original work. To the far right on this continuum we find 'descriptive' relationships that involve new works describing some original work. FRBR reminds us of the importance of these relationships and keeps us focused on those of most importance to meeting user tasks."
15,3,"Whole/part and part to part relationships are also in FRBR. When we provide bibliographic control for electronic digital resources, we find these whole/part and part-to-part relationships especially relevant. For example, a website may be viewed as the 'whole' and the components as its 'parts,' or we may view the whole digitised resource and its components as the parts that will need to be tracked through techni- cal metadata for storing and displaying that digital information."
21,4,"The part-to-part relationships include 'sequential' and 'accompanying' or 'compan- ion' relationships. Companion relationships can be either dependent or independent, which will influence how many bibliographic records we would make for the related works and their manifestations."
25,5,"In fact the number of records we make is a decision made up front by the catalo- ger based on local policies reflecting local user needs. We may choose to catalog at various levels: the collection of works (FRBR calls this an aggregation), an individual work, or a component of a work. At the collection level we may include a description of all the parts and should provide access to each component. At the component level we should provide a link to relate to the larger 'whole.' FRBR reminds us that these relationships are important factors for fulfilling user tasks regardless of what we choose to view as the 'whole.'"
33,6,User tasks
34,7,"So what are these FRBR user tasks? Briefly, they are: find, identify, select, and obtain. 'Find' involves meeting a user's search criteria through an attribute or a relationship of an entity. This can be seen to combine both the traditional 'find' and 'collocate' objectives of a catalog. 'Identify' enables a user to confirm they have found what they looked for, distinguishing among similar resources. 'Select' involves meeting a user's requirements with respect to content, physical format and SO forth, or to reject an entity that does not meet the user's needs. 'Obtain' enables a user to acquire an entity through purchase, loan, or electronic remote access, for example."
42,8,"Additionally, FRBR recognises the importance of being able to navigate, and we could add other tasks relevant to specific users, such as tasks for rights management or preservation communities. These user tasks reinforce the traditional objectives"
