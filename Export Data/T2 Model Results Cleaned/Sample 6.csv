0,0,Q1,"relations. The document, then, is no longer for history an inert material through which it tries to reconstitute what men have done or said, the events of which only the trace remains; history is now trying to define within the documentary material itself unities, totalities, series, relations. History must be detached from the image that satisfied it for SO long, and through which it found its anthropological justification: that of an age-old collective consciousness that made use of material documents to refresh its memory; history is the work expended on material documentation (books, texts, accounts, registers, acts, buildings, institutions, laws, tech- niques, objects, customs, etc.) that exists, in every time and place, in every society, either in a spontancous or in a consciously organized form. The document is not the fortunate tool of a history that is primarily and fundamentally memory; history is one way in which a society recognizes and develops a mass of documentation with which it is inextricably linked."
15,1,Q1,"To be brief, then, let us say that history, in its traditional form, under- took to 'memorize' the monuments of the past, transform them into documents, and lend speech to those traces which, in themselves, are often"

In that area where, in the past, history deciphered the traces left by men, it now deploys a mass of elements that have to be grouped, made relevant, placed in relation to one another to form totalities. There was a time when archaeology, as a discipline devoted to silent monuments, inert traces, objects without context, and things left by the past, aspired to the condition of history, and attained meaning only through the restitu- tion of a historical discourse; it might be said, to play on words a little, that in our time history aspires to the condition of archaeology, to the intrinsic description of the monument. This has several consequences. First of all, there is the surface effect al- ready mentioned: the proliferation of discontinuities in the history of ideas, and the emergence of long periods in history proper. In fact, in its tradi- tional form, history proper was concerned to define relations (of simple causality, of circular determination, of antagonism, of expression) be- tween facts or dated events: the series being known, it was simply a question of defining the position of each element in relation to the other elements in the series. The problem now is to constitute series: to define the elements proper to each series, to fix its boundaries, to reveal its own specific type of relations, to formulate its laws, and, beyond this, to"
