The authors after establishing a dialogue between knowledge organization, information studies and theories and meth- ods of social sciences, came up with the possibility of in- dicating paths of the health field as a knowledge domain and a scientific field. The health domain shows gaps re- lated to the social conditions of knowledge production and it is claimed that the theories and methods of knowl-"

12,3,Q1,"The following article by María López-Huertas calls atten- tion to interdisciplinary knowledge and how this knowl- edge fits into domain analysis theory and methods. The departure point is the idea, poured in the article by Hjor- land and Albrechtsen (1995), that the theory of domain analysis is mainly oriented towards disciplinary spaces and because of that, it raises doubts about the ability of this method to represent inter and transdisciplinary fields. To find out possible deviations, it compares the essential"

It approaches the topic by studying several angles of it that range from the methodo- logical approaches, finding that most contributions are in- fometric or terminological and that the discourse analysis is growing over time, to the identification of the research front, core authors and data about most productive au- thors, countries, etc. It also gives results obtained from the analysis of co-citation, inter-citation and cited references that allow Smiraglia to arrive at the most cited authors, to claim that there is some evidence of discourse among the core authors and to state that there is a strong influence of the foundational contributions of domain analysis for knowledge organization. On the other hand, the core community's discourse on domain analysis is oriented to- wards ontological discovery for knowledge organization, epistemologically towards bibliometrics in information sci- ence at the time that influences from other fields are also"

42,0,Q3,"characteristics of interdisciplinary knowledge based on the contributions by Klein (2010, Repko (2008), Nowotny (2001) and Gibbons (1994), among others, to those of disciplinary knowledge taken from Sugimoto and Weingart (2015). After a reflection on the nature and meaning of said characteristics, it was quite evident that there is no correspondence between both kinds of knowledge to a large extent. So it was clear that domain analysis would need a reformulation in order to extend the parameters of the theory. The second part of the pa- per is devoted to a reflection on the methods for domain analysis (Hjorland, 2002), considering that these were de- signed keeping in mind the disciplinary context, as it was the seminal theory. Only those considered the most ap- propriate methods for interdisciplinary contexts were studied: indexing and retrieving specialties, terminological studies, constructing special classifications and thesauri, bibliometrical studies, empirical user studies, document and genre studies and epistemological and critical studies. This last reflection suggests that the methods of domain analysis should be extended and or reinterpreted in order to incorporate the peculiarities of the ID and to incorpo- rate additional methods if needed."
65,1,Q3,"Richard Smiraglia authors the fourth paper. He looks into the production of domain analytical knowledge for knowl- edge organization along two decades (2004-2014). He pro- duces a domain analysis of domain analysis with specific reference to knowledge organization. In his words (602), ""this study reports an analysis of the effort by scholars to respond to the call for the use of domain analysis as a methodological paradigm in KO."" The paper's objective is to contribute to theory-building through domain analysis"

In Smiraglia words (610), ""do- main analysis for KO is a very vibrant field of research and development not only for KO as a science but for human- ity at large."""
81,1,Q4,"The following article is written by K. Raghavan, K. Apoorva and Aarty Jivrajani. They analyze the domain of information retrieval in order to map the borders of the research literature on said domain over a period of 14 years. Definitions of domains and domain analysis are given in this research context, understanding the latter as (592) ""the process of mapping the contours of a domain with a view to study its evolution and transformation over time,"" and stressing its capacity to study its evolution over time, to know the trends of the research and to visualize the topics that make up the domain. To carry out the study, the authors use two data sets coming from the IEEE and EBSCO databases. One of the reasons of"
94,2,Q4,this choice is that the points of view of both are differ- ent; LISTA is focused on the LIS community and IEEE is more computer science oriented. To see the differences between the two is an objective of this study. The results show that a few areas are of common interest to the re-

It is evident that information retrieval is moving towards new territories, according to the top twenty research themes identified in the study. The analysis of this group shows that information retrieval is changing its dimen- sions as a domain in both databases. The Web has been"
