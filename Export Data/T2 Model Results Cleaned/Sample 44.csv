Furthermore, the relevance of change of concepts must be taken into consideration Ontologies exhibit different levels of abstraction; top- level ontologies, for example, apply to any domain of in- terest, whereas upper-domain and domain ontologies are related to more restricted domains.

Quine (1951) emphasized that a clear separation between analytic and synthetic truths can- not be made; on the other hand, top-level ontologies are the most basic and they play-in a sense-a pseudo- analytical role. The interrelations between ontologies of different levels of abstraction needs further investigation, and a contribution to a formal-logical analysis is presented in Palchunov (2005). We distinguish four basic types of domains: the domain of the material world, the domain of the mental-psychological world, the domain of the social world, and, finally, the domain of abstract, ideal entities."

There is a close relation between categories and language, hence, any analysis of the notion of a category must include the in- vestigation of language. 3.2 Universals, concepts, and symbols"
31,2,Q2,"We draw on the ideas of Gracia (1999), who distinguished various basic types of categories. We distinguish at least three kinds of categories: universals, concepts, and symbol structures. Universals are categories which are independ- ent of the mind; they are classified into intrinsic and ideal universals. Intrinsic universals are constituents of the"

Ideal universals are existentially independent of the material real world and of the mind, as for example numbers, geometric enti- ties, and platonic ideas. Concepts are categories that are represented as mean- ings in someone's mind. Concepts are a result of common"
45,0,Q3,"Basic ideas on these ontological regions were established by Hartmann (1964), and further elaborated by Poli (2001). It is an important task of the onto-axiomatic method to develop means to support the solution of the basic prob- lems mentioned above. This is work in progress. 3.0 The GFO-framework"
51,1,Q3,"In this section, we give an overview of the GFO- framework; a more detailed exposition is presented in Herre (2010) and Herre et al. (2007). General Formal On- tology (GFO) is a top-level ontology which is being de- veloped at the university of Leipzig. 3.1 Categories, instances, and modes of existence"

59,3,Q3,"the theory of Ingarden (1964) who distinguishes several modes of being: absolute, ideal, real, and intentional enti- ties. The basic distinction of entities is between categories and instances. A category is an entity, being independent of time and space, which can be predicated of other enti- ties. The predication relation is closely related to the in- stantiation relation, and the feature of being instantiable holds only for categories. On the opposite, individuals are singular entities which cannot be instantiated. The instances of a category are not necessarily individuals, they can be categories again. Cate- gories are entities expressed by predicative terms of a formal or natural language that can be predicated of other"

We hold that universals can only accessed through concepts, hence for the establishing of knowledge the category of concepts is the most important one. Symbols are signs or texts that can be instantiated by tokens. There is a close relation between these three kinds of categories: a universal is captured by a concept which is individually grasped by a mental representation, and the concept and its representation are denoted by a symbol structure being an expression of a language. Texts and symbolic struc- tures may be communicated by their instances that a physical tokens. 3.3 Ontological basic distinctions"
88,1,Q4,"Entities are classified into categories and individuals. The basic entities of space and time are chronoids and to- poids; these are considered as individuals. The ontology of space and time is inspired by ideas of Brentano (1976). The GFO theory of time is presented in Baumann et al. (2012). Individuals are divided into concrete and abstract. Concrete individuals exist in time or space, whereas ab- stract individuals are independent of time and space. Ac- cording to their relations to time, concrete individuals are classified into continuants, presentials and processes. Processes happen in time and are said to have a temporal extension. Continuants persist through time and have a lifetime, which is a chronoid. A continuant exhibits at any time point of its lifetime a uniquely determined entity, called presential, which is wholly present at the (unique) time boundary of its existence."
