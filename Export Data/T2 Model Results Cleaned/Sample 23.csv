In other words, bibliographic records may be made navigable by the establishment of hyperlinked bibliographic relationships. In fact, navigability de- pends on machine-understandability. More cross- referential hyperlinks between related entities mean higher navigability. The fourth most important work published on bibliographic relationships is the 1998 final report of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR). In FRBR chapter 5, ""Relationships,"" the section on ""Other Relationships Between Group 1 Entities"" categorizes bibliographic relationships first by the level of the entities involved (work, expres- sion, manifestation, item) then by type of relation- ship, each of which is named (IFLA 2007). It should be noted that Barbara Tillett was a consultant to the"

Chapter 5 of the FRBR final report and several sections of RDA (5-10) fo- cused on the relationships between bibliographic en- tities, and their context within the FRBR model. As described in the FRBR final report, the primary role of bibliographic relationships is to ""serve as the vehicle for depicting the link between one entity and another, and thus as the means of assisting the user to navigate the universe that is represented in a bibliog- raphy, catalogue, or bibliographic database"" (IFLA 2007, 64). The FRBR Group 1 entities of work, ex- pression, manifestation, and item can be related to each other in a variety of ways: work to work, expres- sion to expression, work to expression, expression to manifestation and SO on (see Table 1). The ability to identify, build, and maintain various types of bibliographic relationships is a key function- ality of a FRBRized system. Bibliographic relation- ships provide a means to connect and navigate be- tween related entities through the syndetic structure of the catalog. Andersen (2002, 57) argued that ""Bib- liographic relationships are textual means to provide structure in the bibliographic textual space."" But they can be textual or non-textual (e.g., URI) and could be accomplished with many different devices, including URI connections, DOI (Digital Object Identifier), ISBN (International Standard Book Number), ISWN (International Standard Work Number), etc. FRBR and RDA offer the possibility to realize the ""finding"" and ""collocating"" functions of the library catalog, us-"

Both informa- tion types (on work and on related entities) should be available in the catalog because the user generally starts with searching for a work and eventually pro- ceeds to the selection of a specific edition (Zagor- skaya 2000). 4.0 Data analysis"
80,1,Q4,"The FRBR final report provides a taxonomy of bib- liographic relationships in chapter 5, illustrating bib- liographic relationships in 11 tables. The FRBR tax- onomy of bibliographic relationships is shown in comparison with Tillett's taxonomy of bibliographic relationships in the following Table 1. A check mark () means that there is an exact match. Some types of bibliographic relationships shown in Table 1 are very broad and also very frequent in bib- liographic records as indicated in the previous re- search conducted by Tillett and Smiraglia (e.g., de- rivative), while others occur infrequently (e.g., se- quential and shared characteristic). It is interesting to note that the word ""descriptive"" and the phrase ""shared characteristic"" are not used in chapter 5 of the FRBR report. Tillett's ""descriptive re- lationships"" are not discussed in chapter 5 of FRBR, because they are considered part of the ""subject"" rela- tionships (FRBR, Figure 3.3). Tillett (2011) indicated that ""FRBR does not explicitly mention the types of descriptive relationships, but does include them indi- rectly in the diagram (Figure 3.3) showing the Group 3 entities and 'is subject of/has subject' relationships"
