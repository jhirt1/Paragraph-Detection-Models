4,2,Q1,"sification schemes and subject description standards like Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) can reinforce or marginalize culture(s) by including or excluding cultural perspectives. Olson (2000) examines LCSH, and points out that LCSH is based on U.S. centered mainstream per- spectives, which may not represent the whole of lived ex- perience. In addition, both Olson (2000) and Mai (2013) point out the underlying values of warrants, and the myth of pursuing neutral and universal classification scheme and subject description. In the multi-cultural world, the exclu- sion of non-mainstream perspectives is an ethical chal- lenge. Olson (2000) suggests that we accommodate the dynamic changes of both content and relationships of subjects to standards like LCSH. Mai (2013) advocates for developing domain/practice based ethical classifications, which value culture and context. This complements Furner's (2007) critical race theory analysis of the DDC. By allowing subject description changes to reflect cultural dif- ferences, people who share different cultures can experi- ence less of a sense-making gap, and librarians can provide"

30,2,Q2,"group, and 2) culture distinguishes group members from non-members. Some authors explicitly emphasize the two tenets in their definitions. Beyond that, authors disagree. Kluckhohn (1944), Tylor (1958), and Hofstede (1994) think culture is civilization. They approach culture from a progressive perspective, and view culture as a scale with civilized and ignorant as extremes. Goodenough (1971) re- gards culture as rules, guides, and expectations of behav- iors that reside in people's minds, while Steinwachs (1999) sees culture as predisposition and judgment of behavior. Menou (1982) defines culture as the human-made part of human environment. He distinguishes two types of cul- ture: objective/material culture and subjective/non- material culture. Subjective/non-material culture consists of ""code of signs and meanings which shapes the individ- ual and social perception of the universe"" (Menou 1982, 122). It influences people's cognition. Menou lists some"

48,1,Q3,2.0 Culture in Knowledge Organization and Anthropology
50,2,Q3,"Previous research has addressed cultural issues in KO, and emphasized the importance of culturally sensitive knowl- edge organization (Tennis 2013). It is critical to clarify how culture is defined in the literature. We review the KO litera-"
54,3,Q3,"ture and the literature of anthropology to gain a deeper understanding of how scholars view the concept of cul- ture. The review is organized into different families of definitions. We consider culture as 1) nationality or geo- graphic region, 2) context, 3) collective phenomenon, and 4) human-made part of human environment. As mentioned, López-Huertas (2008; 2013) defines cul- ture along national or geographical boundaries. Similarly, Hofstede (1994) and Steinwachs (1999) talk about national culture. National culture is considered one layer of culture which people often refer to when conducting intercultural comparisons, or promoting cooperation among nations. Both Steinwachs and Olson (2000) finds national culture disputable in that national borders do not always corre- spond to boundaries of societies. However, distinguishing culture by nationality is often considered the easier, and sometimes the only feasible way for data collection. Taheri et al. (2014) treat culture as context. In their work, they refer to Islamic culture and Iranian culture, and claim that culture influences attitudes and concepts. Geertz (1973) defines culture as context as well. It is a system of symbols, in which symbols can be thickly described. As a"

Some examples of artifacts include settlements and housing, or language. Menou also provides examples of observable patterns of activity, which include family structure and norms. The list seems to imply that observable patterns of activity are the underlying infrastructures with different levels of influence and restriction on members of the soci-"

One of Kluckhohn's definitions claims that culture is ""that part of the environment that is the creation of man,"" (Kluckhohn 1944, 17) which comports with Menou's definition. 3.0 Manifestations and Elements of Culture"
95,2,Q4,We have looked at different families of definitions of cul- ture. It is clear that culture is multifaceted. Like Geertz
97,3,Q4,"(1973) says, while we want to study culture, we can only study what is observed and described. In order to study culture, scholars tend to identify and examine manifesta- tions of culture, which are not only easy to observe, but indeed the only thing we can observe (Goodenough 1971; Kluckhohn 1944). These observations, and our in- terpretations of them, allow us to study the proxies for culture, and thereby develop and compare definitions, models, and theories. Manifestations are key to this work. The following section will introduce and compare the manifestations as well as the elements (i.e., proposed sub-"
