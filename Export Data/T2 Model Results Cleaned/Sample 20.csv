0,0,Q1,"present embodiment in reality (explicate order) including mediating memory processes (i.e., historically dependent processes) releasing the meaning. Knowledge is tacitly or consciously grasped and interiorized content of information related and meaningfully integrated into a unifying frame of experience among other information contents interiorized in the same way, the complex of which reflects subjective un- derstanding of environment. Mistakes arise from integration of misinformation or from integration of contradictory infor- mation into a unifying frame of experience (the second leads to cognitive dissonance and motivates to seek another infor- mation).

12,1,Q1,"Data are perceptible or perceived-if and when the signal can be interpreted by the ""user'-attributes of physical, bio- logical, social or conceptual entities. Information is recorded and organized data that can be communicated (Porat & Rubin, 1977). However, it is advisable to distin- guish between the various states or conditions of informa- tion (e.g. information-as an object (Buckland, 1991b), or semantic, syntactic and paradigmatic states (Menou, 1995). Knowledge is information that is understood, further to its utilization, stored, retrievable and reusable under appropri- ate circumstances or conditions. [30] (Michel Menou)"
23,2,Q1,"Data are sets of characters, symbols, numbers, and audio/vi- sual bits that are represented and/or encountered in raw forms. Inherently, knowledge is needed to decipher data and turn them into information. Information is facts, figures, and other forms of meaningful representations that when"
28,0,Q2,"Signs. The distinctive feature of signs is that they denote something, regardless of whether that something exists or does not exist, is concrete or abstract, possible or impossible, a thing or an event, a substance or a determination, an indi- vidual or a collective. Analysis even of one single sign leads to a multiplicity of signs and their denoted items. For this reason, we may say that the sign contains a reference to both the denoted item considered per se, in isolation, and the con- texts or situations in which the denoted item appears. And of these of especial importance are those that, for lack of better terminology, we can call the proximal context and the distal context. The proximal context is the net of relations that hold among the items denoted by signs. On the other hand, the distal context is the outcome of a categorization procedure. Its most usual form is that constituted by the reply to ques- tions like 'what is this?', where acceptable replies are of the type 'this is an animate being', 'this is an artifact', 'this is a property', etc. This codification of the two types of context enables me to propose the following distinction between data and information."
48,1,Q2,"Datum. Def. 1. X is a datum = X is a sign that denotes enti- ties or attributes in a proximal context. In the light of this de- finition one understands why conventional analyses of con- sistency and integrity, or procedures of normalization, are effective techniques for the organization and rationalization of data. From a technological point of view, relational data- bases are the currently most advanced products available for the efficient handling of data."
56,0,Q3,"encountered by or presented to a human being are used to en- hance his/her understanding of a subject or related topics. Knowledge is a reservoir of information that is stored in the human mind. It essentially constitutes the information that can be ""retrieved"" from the human mind without the need to consult external information sources. [31] (Haidar Moukdad)"
62,1,Q3,"Data are raw material of information, typically numeric. Information is data which is collected together with com- mentary, context and analysis SO as to be meaningful to others. Knowledge is a combination of information and a person's experience, intuition and expertise. [32] (Charles Oppenheim)"
67,2,Q3,"Datum is an object or crude fact perceived by the subject, non-constructed nor elaborated in the consciousness, without passing through neither analysis processes nor evaluation for its transfer as information. Information is a phenomenon generated from knowledge and integrated therein, analyzed and interpreted to achieve the transfer process of message (i.e., meaningful content) and the cog- nitive transformations of people and communities, in a historical, cultural and social context. Knowledge is a so- cial and cognitive process formed by the passing or as- similated information to thought and to action. Message is the meaningful content of information. [33] (Lena Vania Pinheiro)"
80,3,Q3,"Data are primitive symbolic entities, whose meaning de- pend on it integration within a context that allow their un- derstanding by an interpreter. Information is the intentional composition of data by a sender with the goal of modifying the knowledge state of an interpreter or receiver. Knowl- edge is the intelligent information processing by the receiver and it consequent incorporation to the individual or social memory (Belkin & Robertson, 1976; Blair, 2002) [34] (Maria Pinto)"

90,0,Q4,"Information. Def. 2. X is an item of information = X is a datum in a distal context. Definition 2 tells us that informa- tion is made up of more structured items. That is to say, in- formation is the embedding of signs-in-a-proximal-context (i.e., data) in a distal context. Information, thus, adds greater structure to data. These definitions provide a first explana- tion for the scant interest aroused by proposals to draw more exact distinctions between data and information. In effect, in concrete cases of application, it is often difficult to distin- guish precisely between distal and proximal contexts."
100,1,Q4,"Conditions of knowledge. Knowledge is apparently not re- ducible solely to information and data. The problem is to un- derstand 'what is lacking', what must be added to information and data in order to achieve true knowledge. My claim is that the meaning of a sign is given by the position of the sign in a field of signs (in a space). On the other hand, the content of a sign is given by the position of the item (denoted by the sign) in a field of items. Data, information, meanings and contents cover the field of knowledge. This amounts to saying that we have knowledge when we know (1) which item is denoted by which sign, (2) the item's proximal context, (3) the item's dis- tal contexts, (4) the sign's position in the field of signs, (5) the item's position in the field of items (Poli, 2001)."
113,2,Q4,"Data, information, knowledge, message. I am unable to understand why data, information, knowledge and message are placed on the same level of analysis. I would suggest considering message as the ""vehicle"" carrying either data or information (which can be taken as synonymous). Knowl- edge hints to either a systematic framework (e.g., laws, rules or regularities, that is higher-order ""abstractions"" from data) or what somebody or some community knows (""I know that you are married""). In this latter sense knowledge presents"
