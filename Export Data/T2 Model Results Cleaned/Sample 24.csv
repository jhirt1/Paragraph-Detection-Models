2,1,Q1,"standard, Resource Description and Access (RDA), with the Committee of Princi- ples. A new governing structure for RDA was announced in 2015, and on Novem- ber 6, the JSC was renamed RDA Steering Committee, and the Committee of Principles was renamed RDA Board. The RDA Board and the RDA Steering Com- mittee currently guide the development of RDA as a global cataloging standard. The new governing structure is expected to be firmly established by 2019. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Study Group on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records developed an entity-relationship model as a tool to obtain a generalized view of the biblio- graphic universe in its Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records: Final Report. It was intended to be independent from any cataloging code. 4 The final FRBR report was first published in 1998 and later updated in 2009. Almost a decade was devoted to formulating the conceptual model of FRBR and the related Functional Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD), first published in 2009. Later, Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) was approved in 2010 and issued in its final form in 2011. 6 FRBR and FRAD were the first con-"

""7 IFLA is developing the latest conceptual model of bibliographic data needed by users. Currently, the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) is only available in draft. The RDA Steering Committee agreed at its November 2016 meeting to adopt the draft IFLA Library Reference Model as a conceptual model for the future development of Resource Description and Access. This new model will replace the Functional Requirements family of models (FRBR, FRAD, and FRSAD) that are superseded by the LRM. 9 The vocabularies from the new model have been published on the RDA registry, and will be a major part of the complete overhaul of RDA in its RDA Toolkit Restructure and Redesign (3R) Project. 10 Revised terminology from LRM were included in the RDA Toolkit Release, February 14, 2017. In the history of cataloging practice, RDA is the first cataloging standard founded on an explicit conceptual model: FRBR. The instruction and user tasks in RDA were closely tied to the FRBR and FRAD models. Our research will investi- gate RDA entities and relationships as defined by these conceptual models and standardized in RDA. As Barbara Tillett stated in What is FRBR? A Conceptual Model for the Bibliographic Universe, ""FRBR offers us a fresh perspective on the structure and relationships of bibliographic and authority records, and also a more precise vocabulary to help future cataloging rule makers and system designers in meeting user needs."" The implementation of the new cataloging standard, RDA, in 2013, became a unique opportunity to investigate bibliographic relationships in RDA records."
